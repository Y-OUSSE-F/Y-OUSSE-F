# Youssef Agour

Hey there! I'm Youssef, an aspiring data scientist with a keen interest in leveraging data to solve real-world problems and tell real stories. Currently based in New York City, I'm currently a graduating student of Fordham University with an undergraduate degree in Global Business on the Tech Track. In my most recent role, I was employed in Data & Operations at a non-profit organization focused on workforce development. With experience across VC, Saas tech start-ups, and non-profits, I bring a wide breath of perspective with deep thought and attention to detail wherever I go.
