# Youssef Agour

Hey there! I'm Youssef, an aspiring data scientist with a keen interest in leveraging data to solve real-world problems and tell real stories. Currently based in New York City, I'm a graduating student of Fordham University with a bachelor's degree in Global Business, minoring in Information Technology. In my most recent role, I was employed as a Data Analyst at a non-profit organization focused on workforce development, where I worked on the business operations team. With experience across VC, Saas tech start-ups, and non-profits, I bring a wide breath of perspective with deep thought and attention to detail wherever I go.
