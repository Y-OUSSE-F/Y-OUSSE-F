# Hello, World!

I’m @Y-OUSSE-F, 
I’m interested in Data Science & Machine Learning, and I am currently working towards a personal certification, as well as my Undergraduate Degree concentrating in Digital Media & Technology, majoring in Global Business!
I like to solve real problems and tell stories by using real data.
Feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn!: https://www.linkedin.com/in/youssef-agour/

Currently I work in Data & Operations at a non-profit organization that works in workforce development. I am located in New York City, and have worked in R-Studio, Python, MySQL Workbench. I hope my profile brings you more insight into my interests and what sorts of analysis I like to conduct!
